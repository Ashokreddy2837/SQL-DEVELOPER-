VIEW
=====
View are data base objects which is used to provide security,generally views are stored select satement.view are does't
stores any data.views are from the tables those table tables are base tables.

views are to type 
	1.simple views
	2.complex views
simples views are created from only one base table but complex views are stored multiple base tables.

SIMPLE VIEW:
===========
EX:
CREATEOR REPLACE VIEW V1
AS
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO = 10;

DML OPERATIONS ON SIMPLE VIEW:
=============================
-->If simple view having group functions,group by clause,destinct,rownum,set operator then can't peforme
	DML operations trough simple view to base table.
-->we must include base table not null value column or primary key column into the view then only we allowed to performe dml
	operations through base table.


note:
====
IN oracle when a having function or experssion then we must create  alias name per those functions or expersions
other wise orcale server returns error.

create or replace view v1
as
select deptno, count(*) from emp group by deptno having count(*)>3;
               *
ERROR:
------
must name this expression with a column alias

create or replace view v1
as
select deptno, count(*) as cuntemp from emp group by deptno having count(*)>3;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
select * from v1;

    DEPTNO    CUNTEMP
---------- ----------
        30          6
        20          5
		
Complex views:
=============
-->views which is created from multiple base tables is also called as complex views.
-->Generally in all database we cant perorme dml operations on complex views.
EX:
--
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW V2
AS
SELECT NAME,SUB FROM TEST1,TEST2:
----------------------------------------

Materilized views:
=================
-->Materilized views are stored date but views are doesn't store any date.materilized views are used to improve the peromence
	of the joins and aggeregateble querys.
-->Materilized views store data same as table but when we are REFRESH materilized view if synchronized data based on base 	  table.

CREATE OR REPLACE Materilized VIEW V3
AS
SELECT DNAME , SUM(SAL)
FROM EMP E ,DEPT D
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
GROUP BY DNAME;

View vs Materilized view
========================
view:
=====
-->view does't store any Data.
-->view are sercurity purpose.
-->when we are droping a table view can't be ACCESSible
--> we can performe DML Operations on views.

Materilized view:
================
-->it store data 
-->Improve the performance of the querys
-->when drop a table we cant access Materilized view.
-->we can't perform DML operations.


Force view:
==========
View are created with out having any base table is called force view.

Read only views:
===============
when a view having with read only opetional clause then we cant perform DML operations through view to base table.

ex:
===
create or replace view v2
AS
select * from emp where deptno = 10 with read only;
